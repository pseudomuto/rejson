# (r)EJSON

[![CI](https://github.com/pseudomuto/rejson/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pseudomuto/rejson/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

A rust port of EJSON with a few extra bells and whistles. Full credit should go to the team that made EJSON. No
innovation here other than needing Rust bindings and wanting a few extra features I'm not sure belonged upstream.
